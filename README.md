# Software Engineering Project


# How to get started

- You will have to install Flutter SDK (just google and download)
- Then you need to install Android SDK (Its a while new IDE but we wont have to use it, you just need it for the emulator)
- Add flutter to path so that the "flutter" commands work
- Run "flutter doctor" and if there is a problem with Andoid, then you probably need to install "android command line tools" 
    - https://developer.android.com/studio -> its at the bottom of this page
    - Then you extract that zipped file into users/YourUsername/AppData/local/Android/sdk
    - Then when you run the "flutter doctor" it gives a command to fix this

When you run it, you first have to start the emulator and then just type "flutter run" in the terminal.
